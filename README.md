# NASA EPIC API Wallpapers

A simple script, written in Python, that interfaces with NASA's EPIC API to download the latest images of Earth.

## Purpose

This script was created because I was getting bored with my wallpaper, and thought it would be cool to have a (near) live view of the Earth as the background to my work.

## Usage

I have this script set up in Windows Task Scheduler to run everytime I log in. Details on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.jcchouinard.com/python-automation-using-task-scheduler/).

Just modify `image_type` to your preference, and set `wallpaper_path` to wherever you store your wallpapers. I have Windows use that folder as a slideshow, which gives a neat effect of the Earth rotating every now and then.

## Improvements

This script is far from perfect. More options for usage and better error handling may be in the future for this project.

## Contribution

I am always open to new ideas and suggestions. Feel free to create a PR, or contact me at cfordx86@gmail.com.
